Idea For Potential Game Mechanics:

Character Selection: 
Players can choose to play as either a Rat or a Pie. Each choice offers a unique set of abilities and gameplay experiences.
    
Multiplayer:
Pie-Rats can be a multiplayer game where players compete against each other. You can have various multiplayer modes, including local split-screen and online gameplay.

PvE Elements: 
In addition to player-versus-player (PvP) modes, consider adding player-versus-environment (PvE) elements where players face off against AI-controlled enemies, like chef bots or traps.

Pies' Abilities: 
Pies can have abilities like rolling or bouncing, depending on the type of pie they are (e.g., apple pie, cherry pie, or cream pie). Players can use these abilities to move around the environment or interact with    other players.
    
Rats' Abilities: 
Rats may have abilities like digging tunnels, climbing walls, or stealing ingredients from Pies. These abilities would allow them to navigate the game world and disrupt the Pies' objectives.

Objective-Based Gameplay: 
The primary objective for Pies could be to collect ingredients scattered throughout the game world and bake a pie, while Rats aim to steal those ingredients or sabotage the baking process.

Unique Environments: 
The game can feature various settings, such as a bustling kitchen, a pirate ship, or a hidden underground lair. Each environment could have its challenges and opportunities.
 
Crafting System: 
Pies could have a crafting system to assemble various pie types with different attributes (e.g., speed, durability, or special effects) using the collected ingredients.

Upgrades and Customization: 
Allow players to upgrade their Rat or Pie characters with special abilities or customizations to suit their playstyle.

Power-Ups: 
Scatter power-ups across the map that both Rats and Pies can utilize for temporary advantages, such as speed boosts, invincibility, or special attacks.

Challenges and Quests: 
Incorporate a quest system that provides players with tasks, challenges, and rewards for completing specific objectives.

Leaderboards and Rankings: 
Keep track of players' scores and rankings, encouraging competition and replayability.

Team Play: 
Include modes where players can form teams of Rats and Pies, encouraging cooperation and teamwork.

Dynamic Events: 
Randomly triggered events like sudden storms, chef invasions, or ingredient shortages can add unpredictability to the gameplay.
